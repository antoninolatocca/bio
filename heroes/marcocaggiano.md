# Marco Caggiano

Hello guys ! I'm Marco Caggiano, from Torino, North West of Italy.
I speak English very well, Italian, French, i mostly understand Spanish and a bit of Portuguese, and
i also studied a little bit of Turkish while i was living in Istanbul (I can move around Istanbul and Turkey without problems !).
I am a Internet Marketer, i launched some website and infobusiness projects, and worked in the field of Affiliate&Performance Marketing
both as an Affiliate and as a Backend/Frontend Developer.
I can run adversting campaigns on Facebook and Google Adwords, but i'm also a software developer since the age of 14 years old.
I started with Pascal, and then C/C++, Python, Perl, Java, Bash, PHP, CSS, Javascript, Wordpress, and much more...
I'm proud linux usert since the age of 14 years old, and i installed and used Gentoo, Ubuntu, Mandriva, Fedora, Slackware,
so i'm also a terminal fanatics, kind of, but i like GUI also.
I had short love stories with Windows (5 years) and MacOSX(2 years), so i can say i know Windows and Mac quite well.
I also installed Gentoo Linux, with just using the terminal, on an iMac, in 2010/2011.
Due to the growing of the web and working/money reasons i moved quickly on Web Developing and started freelancing, making website
in Wordpress, mobile apps for Android and iOS using Javascript (Ionic, React Native, NativeScripts and so on...), web apps in
PHP+MySQL and Python Flask+SQLAlchemy. I also create frontends using ReactJS, Angular or VueJS, but my favorite is VueJS.
I also wrote a VueJS like microframework in JS, just for fun (https://github.com/mcisback/smartjs).
