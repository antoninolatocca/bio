# Enrico Deleo

I am an holistic digital expert. I grew up during the www era while falling in love with open source technologies and the bricks that make the web (and lately mobile) awesome.

I learned how to code and design driven by my genuine passion and curiosity towards technology, playing with a few personal projects while building my expertise on my own.

During the last few years, I had the pleasure to work for companies such as Hasbro Italia, Koch Media, and Cortilia as well as for public organizations such as the University of Catania.

I co-founded and/or drive as CTO a few startups (namely [VERTICOMICS](https://verticomics.com), [Traction](https://tractionmanagement.it), [Emailurgency](https://emailurgency.com)).

I speak Italian, English, PHP, JavaScript, Bash, a little bit of Java, Objective-C, Swift, Rust and I'm proud to be a DevOp.

I'm quite confident at designing interfaces and make creativities on my own when needed.
